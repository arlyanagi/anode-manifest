## Introduction
anode-manifest is the [repo] repository for [anode].

Checkout [anode] repositories by following commands:
> % mkdir anode-workspace  
> % cd anode-workspace  
> % repo init -u https://github.com/arlyanagi/anode-manifest.git  
> % repo sync  

## Status
This work is at an early stage. I welcome input of all.  
  
  Now, this project is for myself. If you have any idea to be more convenience, would you tell me it. I'll merge it.

## More information
